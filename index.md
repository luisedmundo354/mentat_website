# Mentat: Transforming Medical Decision-Making

**Mentat** is an AI-driven inference device designed to streamline medical decision-making and enhance patient care. By integrating natural language understanding, small language model inference, and a secure local database, it addresses the common pitfalls of manual data entry and verbal communication errors.

## Abstract

Healthcare professionals manage the complex tasks of recording and monitoring patient data, relying on systems prone to errors and time-consuming verbal communication. **Mentat** provides an end-to-end solution that automates data collection, retrieval, and diagnostic insights using a small language model optimized for low-power GPUs. This approach ensures secure, offline operation that does not depend on external servers, preserving patient data integrity.

## Key Features

1. **Efficient Data Recording**  
   - Automates symptom recording and patient history gathering.  
   - Minimizes manual effort and reduces transcription errors.

2. **AI-Assisted Diagnostics**  
   - Small language model (e.g., Phi 3.5 mini on LlamaEdge) runs locally.  
   - Integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context-aware insights.

3. **Secure and Offline**  
   - No reliance on external servers—data remains within the clinic’s network.  
   - Local database integration ensures privacy and data integrity.

4. **Easy Integration**  
   - Designed for quick adoption into existing Healthcare Management Systems (HMS).  
   - Facilitates communication between nurses, doctors, and specialists.
